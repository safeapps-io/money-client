   * Motivation around `type='text'` and `text-security: disc`.
   *
   * Chrome does not allow for disabling autocomplete for password field. At all.
   * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60689757/how-to-disable-chrome-autofill-after-2020
   * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12374442/chrome-ignores-autocomplete-off
   *
   * We have two passwords: the usual one for autorization and the master-password.
   * The problem is that we cannot disable the autocomplete for the master-password. So when
   * user gets a prompt for setting a new password, they always get the autorization one.
   * When they set a new master-password it always replaces the authorization one. It also
   * creates a situation where the browser can store master-password which we call the
   * most important password here.
   *
   * So to disable this behaviour we use `type='text'` and `text-security: disc`, which does
   * not work in Firefox, but that's not that important.
